In some cases windows does not copy (or extract) correctly the links, and this
can give some trouble e.g.:

- 'ls' command do not actually list anything.
- Large directory size (~100 Mb vs ~5 Mb of regular one).

However there is a fix: regenerate all the links. You need to open terminal.bat
with admin rights and issue the following commands:

bblink.sh -r
bblink.sh

Note that the installation is fully portable, so you can change the directory
name, or move somewhere else. But if you duplicate the folder, this issue
could arise again.
